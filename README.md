# Project: plant hotel Greenest.
I am in my first year of the Java Developer program at Nackademin. This is the first assignment in the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## Task
At the greenhouse hotel "Greenest," owners can check in their potted plants for care while the owners are on vacation. At the hotel, the plants are pampered,
get to sunbathe under UV lamps, and receive the optimal amount of nutrient solution of the type each plant needs. Since the formulas are so complicated, the 
hotel owner has difficulty remembering how much liquid each plant needs and asks for help in writing a small program that helps keep track of how much each 
plant should get.
